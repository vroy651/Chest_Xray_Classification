Chest X-ray Classification Project
Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying chest X-ray images into two categories: Pneumonia and Normal. The dataset used for this project contains X-ray images that are divided into three sets: train, validation, and test, with each set containing two subfolders for the categories Pneumonia and Normal. The goal is to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, using PyTorch, that can accurately predict whether a given chest X-ray shows signs of pneumonia or is normal.

Dataset
The dataset consists of 5,863 JPEG images organized into 3 folders:
train: For training the model.
val: For validating the model's performance.
test: For evaluating the final model.
Each folder contains two subfolders:
Pneumonia: X-ray images labeled as having pneumonia.
Normal: X-ray images labeled as normal.

Requirements
To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

Python Packages:
Install the required packages by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Main Packages:
PyTorch: For building and training the CNN model.
Torchvision: For loading and transforming image data.
Matplotlib: For visualizing training curves and predictions.
Scikit-learn: For evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Model Architecture
The model is based on a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with residual connections inspired by ResNet, but adapted for smaller datasets like this one. The architecture includes:

Convolutional Layers: Extract features from the X-ray images.
Residual Blocks: Improve training and avoid vanishing gradients.
Dropout: To prevent overfitting.
Fully Connected Layers: To perform the final classification into Pneumonia or Normal.
Model File: src/model.py
Defines the custom CNN architecture with residual connections.
Includes dropout layers to improve generalization on small datasets.
Training
You can train the model using the train.py script.

Steps:
Load and preprocess the dataset using data augmentation techniques (like random rotations, flips, etc.).
Initialize the custom CNN model.
Train the model using the training set, and evaluate on the validation set.
Use techniques such as learning rate scheduling, early stopping, and model checkpointing to improve performance.
Training Script: src/train.py
bash
Copy code
python src/train.py --epochs 30 --batch_size 32 --lr 0.001
--epochs: Number of epochs to train.
--batch_size: Batch size for training.
--lr: Learning rate for the optimizer.
Testing
Once the model is trained, you can test it on the unseen test set using the test.py script.

Testing Script: src/test.py
bash
Copy code
python src/test.py --model models/chest_xray_model.pth --batch_size 32
Outputs the test accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy: How often the model correctly predicts the labels.
Precision: The proportion of true positives among all positive predictions.
Recall: The proportion of true positives among all actual positives.
F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
Data Augmentation
The model performance can be improved using data augmentation techniques like:

Random Resizing & Cropping
Random Rotations
Horizontal/Vertical Flips
Color Jittering
Augmentation is handled in the train.py script using torchvision.transforms.

Results
The model achieves a test accuracy of X% on the test set.
The confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score can be visualized in the final evaluation step.
Visualization
Training and validation curves, confusion matrix, and sample predictions can be visualized using matplotlib inside the Jupyter notebook located in the notebooks/ folder.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to build a custom CNN with residual connections for classifying chest X-ray images. By using data augmentation and proper model validation techniques, the model is fine-tuned to achieve high accuracy on the test set.

Future Work
Hyperparameter tuning to further improve the model's accuracy.
Try other architectures such as DenseNet or EfficientNet.
Implement cross-validation and ensemble techniques.
